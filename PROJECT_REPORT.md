```

## Key Features & Functionality (Actually Implemented)

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Firebase Authentication for login/register
- Role-based access (Admin/User roles)
- Protected routes that redirect unauthorized users
- Persistent login sessions

### 2. **Dashboard System**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Overview of system statistics, pending requests
- **User Dashboard**: Personal metrics, notifications, quick actions
- Real-time data loading from Firebase

### 3. **Tool Management**
- **Available Tools Page**: Browse and view security tools
- **Tool Request System**: Users can request access to tools
- **Admin Tool Management**: Add, edit, delete tools
- Tool status tracking (active/inactive)

### 4. **Usage Reporting**
- **Usage Report Form**: Detailed reporting system
- **Previous Reports**: View submitted reports with status
- Compliance scoring and tracking
- Admin review and response system

### 5. **CVE Search**
- Integration with National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Search for security vulnerabilities
- Tool-specific vulnerability information

### 6. **User Interface**
- Modern, responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Professional UI components from Radix UI
- Dark/light theme support
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states and error handling

## How It Was Built

### Development Approach
- **React-based frontend** with TypeScript
- **Firebase backend** for data storage and authentication
- **Component-based architecture** using Radix UI
- **Form handling** with React Hook Form and Zod validation

### Build Configuration
- **Vite** for development server and building
- **TypeScript** compilation
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Express server** integration

## Project Strengths

### 1. **Modern Frontend Stack**
- React 18 with TypeScript provides type safety
- TailwindCSS creates professional, responsive design
- Radix UI ensures accessible components
- Vite provides fast development experience

### 2. **Firebase Integration**
- Real-time database with Firestore
- Built-in authentication system
- Scalable cloud infrastructure
- No server maintenance required

### 3. **User Experience**
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Consistent design language throughout
- Smooth navigation between pages

### 4. **Security Features**
- Role-based access control
- Firebase authentication
- Input validation with Zod
- CORS configuration for API security

### 5. **Comprehensive Functionality**
- Complete tool management workflow
- Detailed reporting system
- Real vulnerability search integration
- Admin oversight capabilities

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication** handles user login/registration
- **Role-based access** (admin vs user permissions)
- **Protected routes** prevent unauthorized access
- **Session persistence** keeps users logged in

### Data Security
- **Firebase Firestore** provides secure cloud database
- **Input validation** using Zod schemas
- **CORS configuration** controls cross-origin requests
- **Environment variables** protect sensitive configuration

### Current Security Status
- ✅ **Basic authentication** implemented
